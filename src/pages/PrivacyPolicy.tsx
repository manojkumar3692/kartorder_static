        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>KartOrder</strong> (“we”, “us”,
        “our”) collects, uses and protects information when you use our
        services, including our website and integrations with WhatsApp and other

        automate orders received through WhatsApp and other messaging channels.
        Our customers are businesses (“Merchants”) who use KartOrder to handle
        conversations and orders from their end-users (“Customers”).
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
      <p>Depending on how you interact with KartOrder, we may collect:</p>

      <h3>2.1 Information from Merchants (our business customers)</h3>

        <li>Technical logs such as message timestamps and delivery status</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We process this data on behalf of the Merchant as a{" "}
        <strong>data processor / service provider</strong>. The Merchant remains
        primarily responsible for their end customers’ data.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Technical and usage data</h3>

        <li>IP address, browser type, device type, and basic usage analytics</li>
        <li>Error logs and performance metrics to maintain and improve our service</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. How we use the information</h2>
      <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and operate the KartOrder platform and features</li>
        <li>Send and receive WhatsApp / Meta messages on behalf of Merchants</li>

        <li>
          Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Legal basis (for EU / similar regions)</h2>
      <p>
        Where applicable, we rely on one or more of the following legal bases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Performance of a contract (providing our service to Merchants)</li>
        <li>Legitimate interests (security, fraud prevention, improvements)</li>
        <li>Consent, where required by law (e.g., marketing communications)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. How we work with WhatsApp and Meta</h2>
      <p>
        KartOrder uses official APIs provided by Meta (such as the WhatsApp
        Business Platform) to send and receive messages. When a Merchant
        connects their WhatsApp number:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Message content and metadata may be processed by Meta in accordance
          with Meta’s own terms and privacy policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          We store copies of relevant messages and order data to show them
          inside the KartOrder dashboard and for order history.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        KartOrder is not owned, operated or endorsed by Meta Platforms, Inc.
        WhatsApp and Meta are separate third-party services governed by their
        own terms and policies.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Sharing of information</h2>
      <p>We do not sell personal data. We may share data with:</p>

        <li>
          <strong>Service providers and processors</strong> who help us host,
          store, send messages, process payments or provide analytics. They are
          bound by contractual obligations to protect the data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Merchants:</strong> Customer information and messages are
          shared with the corresponding Merchant that owns the conversation or

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Authorities or legal entities</strong> when required by law,

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes
        described in this policy or as required by law. Merchants may request

        subject to technical and legal limitations.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Data security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data
        against unauthorized access, loss or misuse. However, no system can be
        guaranteed 100% secure, and we encourage users to take appropriate
        precautions when sharing information online.
      </p>

      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have rights such as access,
        correction, deletion or objection to certain processing of your personal
        data.
